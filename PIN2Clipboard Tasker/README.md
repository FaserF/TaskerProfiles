# PIN TO CLIPBOARD Tasker Project


Thanks to XDA for the base project and their great tasker ideas! https://www.xda-developers.com/2-factor-authentication-tasker-android/


## Description

This Project was made to speed up 2 Factor Authentication on Android with Tasker.
Why this one and not the one from XDA: With my project there is no need to pay for any other app or install more apps than Tasker itself. Furthermore I support Pushbullet :)


## How-to-use

How to use this project?
1. Get Tasker (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm)
2. Copy all files in TaskerProfiles/PIN2Clipboard Tasker/ (https://github.com/FaserF/TaskerProfiles/archive/master.zip) to your phone on /Tasker/profiles
3. Now open Tasker and long press on Profiles -> Import
4. Thats it!

## What does it do?

It will wait for a new SMS to come. Once arrived it checks if the SMS contains the word PIN or Code. If so it will automatically detect the PIN Code and copy it to the clipboard and send the code via pushbullet to your devices.
